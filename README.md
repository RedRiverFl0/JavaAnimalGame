# JavaAnimalGame
This Java project is an animal guessing game where the program would have to guess your animal, it learns after each game!

How it works:
First the user would have to think of an animal then start the game.
Then the program will have three phases, first guessing the animal features, guess animal, then add animal (if guess was not right)
The program will guess which the animal feature it has is by process of binary tree.
Now once it would reach to the parent of the leaf it would then guess the animal.  
If that is not the animal it would then prompt the user what animal the user was thinkin. 
After the user inputs the animal then the program would ask what features the animal they were thinking about had that the previous animal did not have.
Then the program would add the new animal to a text document to extend it's memory.
